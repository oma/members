# Members

App to help inviting members and to coordinate general meetings

## Setup and installation

See README at https://github.com/rubykurs/bootstrap for more info on how this app was built and started out. This app is based off on that and it is more likely to be updated than 'yet another app'

# start
bundle install  #NB: jeg opplever noen rare ting med at executablen ikke blir registrert etter gem install bundler og bundle. Gj√∏r da `cd ..` og `cd members`, det har av snodige grunner funkert oss meg.

rake db:migrate
rake test

rake db:seed #Loads what's in db/seeds.rb
rails s #start server


# Server
